## Setup

To setup the app,

1. Clone the app to your local machine and run `npm install`
2. Then run `npm start`

## Folder Structure

The structure should look like this:

```
joyntmeet-ui/
  config
  node_modules/
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
    load.csss
  scripts/
    build.js
    start.js
    test.js
  src/
    app
    config
    pages
    redux
    routes
    scss
    shared
    index.js
    serviceWorker.js
  .env
  .gitignore
  package.json
  README.md
  server.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

## Reuseable Components

The reuseable components in this projects are components that may be shared by two or more components. We have decided to have them in the **_shared_** folder.

## Modularized Pages

Within the **pages** folder, we have sort of modularized the project. So all outfit pages, for example, are batched together as **_Auth_** folder. Likewise if you were adding pages that relates to **Order**, they would be grouped into order folder. That way, the components appear to be modularized

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However it is understood that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers.<br>
Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).

## Changing the Page `<title>`

If you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API.

## Importing a Component

This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Webpack.<br>
While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.

For example:

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}

export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!
```

### `DangerButton.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Button from "./Button"; // Import a component from another file

class DangerButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button color="red" />;
  }
}

export default DangerButton;
```

## Code Splitting

Instead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.

This project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 3. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.

Here is an example:

### `moduleA.js`

```js
const moduleA = "Hello";

export { moduleA };
```

### `App.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    import("./moduleA")
      .then(({ moduleA }) => {
        // Use moduleA
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        // Handle failure
      });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button.

You can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.

## Adding a Stylesheet

This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:

### `Button.css`

```css
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./Button.css"; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // You can use them as regular CSS styles
    return <div className="Button" />;
  }
}
```

**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-blog/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.

In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.

If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.

## Adding a CSS Modules Stylesheet

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

This project supports [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) alongside regular stylesheets using the `[name].module.css` file naming convention. CSS Modules allows the scoping of CSS by automatically creating a unique classname of the format `[filename]\_[classname]\_\_[hash]`.

> **Tip:** Should you want to preprocess a stylesheet with Sass then make sure to [follow the installation instructions](#adding-a-sass-stylesheet) and then change the stylesheet file extension as follows: `[name].module.scss` or `[name].module.sass`.

CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes. Learn more about CSS Modules [here](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/).

### `Button.module.css`

```css
.error {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### `another-stylesheet.css`

```css
.error {
  color: red;
}
```

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import styles from "./Button.module.css"; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
import "./another-stylesheet.css"; // Import regular stylesheet

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // reference as a js object
    return <button className={styles.error}>Error Button</button>;
  }
}
```

### Result

No clashes from other `.error` class names

```html
<!-- This button has red background but not red text -->
<button class="Button_error_ax7yz"></div>
```

**This is an optional feature.** Regular `<link>` stylesheets and CSS files are fully supported. CSS Modules are turned on for files ending with the `.module.css` extension.

## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153).

Here is an example:

```js
import React from "react";
import logo from "./logo.png"; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>
An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

### Adding SVGs

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

One way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:

```js
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from "./logo.svg";
const App = () => (
  <div>
    {/* Logo is an actual React component */}
    <Logo />
  </div>
);
```

This is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The `ReactComponent` import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.

## Using the `public` Folder

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.

### Changing the HTML

The `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it.
The `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.

### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System

You can also add other assets to the `public` folder.

Note that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.
For example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).
This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

- Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
- Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.

However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.

Inside `index.html`, you can use it like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
```

Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.

When you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:

```js
render() {
  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!
  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs
  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.
  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.png'} />;
}
```

Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:

- None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.
- Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.

### When to Use the `public` Folder

Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.
The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:

- You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
- You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.
- Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.

## Using Global Variables

When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.

You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:

```js
const $ = window.$;
```

This makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.

Alternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.

## Adding Bootstrap

You don’t have to use [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:

Install reactstrap and Bootstrap from npm. reactstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:

```sh
npm install --save reactstrap bootstrap@4
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add bootstrap@4 reactstrap
```

Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your `src/index.js` file:

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
// components takes precedence over default styles.
```

Import required reactstrap components within `src/App.js` file or your custom component files:

```js
import { Button } from "reactstrap";
```

Now you are ready to use the imported reactstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method.

### Using a Custom Theme

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

Sometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).<br>
As of `react-scripts@2.0.0` you can import `.scss` files. This makes it possible to use a package's built-in Sass variables for global style preferences.

To customize Bootstrap, create a file called `src/custom.scss` (or similar) and import the Bootstrap source stylesheet. Add any overrides _before_ the imported file(s). You can reference [Bootstrap's documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/#css-variables) for the names of the available variables.

```scss
// Override default variables before the import
$body-bg: #000;

// Import Bootstrap and its default variables
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
```

> **Note:** You must prefix imports from `node_modules` with `~` as displayed above.

Finally, import the newly created `.scss` file instead of the default Bootstrap `.css` in the beginning of your `src/index.js` file, for example:

```javascript
import "./custom.scss";
```

## Running Tests

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br>

> [Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)

Create React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.

Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.

While Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.

We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.

### Filename Conventions

Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
- Files with `.test.js` suffix.
- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.

We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.

### Command Line Interface

When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.

The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:

![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)

### Version Control Integration

By default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.

Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.

Jest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.

### Writing Tests

To create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.

Jest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:

```js
import sum from "./sum";

it("sums numbers", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
});
```

All `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#content).<br>
You can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.

### Testing Components

There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.

Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

it("renders without crashing", () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
});
```

This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot of value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.

When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.

If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To install it, run:

```sh
npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
```

As of Enzyme 3, you will need to install Enzyme along with an Adapter corresponding to the version of React you are using. (The examples above use the adapter for React 16.)

The adapter will also need to be configured in your [global setup file](#initializing-test-environment):

#### `src/setupTests.js`

```js
import { configure } from "enzyme";
import Adapter from "enzyme-adapter-react-16";

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

> Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won't contain any reference to it. [Read here](#initializing-test-environment) to learn how to add this after ejecting.

Now you can write a smoke test with it:

```js
import React from "react";
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import App from "./App";

it("renders without crashing", () => {
  shallow(<App />);
});
```

Unlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.

You can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.

Here is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:

```js
import React from "react";
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import App from "./App";

it("renders welcome message", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toBe(true);
  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

All Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html).<br>
Nevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.

Additionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written more simply with jest-enzyme.

```js
expect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome);
```

To enable this, install `jest-enzyme`:

```sh
npm install --save jest-enzyme
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add jest-enzyme
```

Import it in [`src/setupTests.js`](#initializing-test-environment) to make its matchers available in every test:

```js
import "jest-enzyme";
```

### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries

We recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).

However, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:

```js
import sinon from "sinon";
import { expect } from "chai";
```

and then use them in your tests like you normally do.

### Initializing Test Environment

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.

If your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.

For example:

#### `src/setupTests.js`

```js
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
  clear: jest.fn(),
};
global.localStorage = localStorageMock;
```

> Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won't contain any reference to it, so you should manually create the property `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` in the configuration for Jest, something like the following:

> ```js
> "jest": {
>   // ...
>   "setupTestFrameworkScriptFile": "<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js"
>  }
> ```

### Focusing and Excluding Tests

You can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>
Similarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.

### Coverage Reporting

Jest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>
Run `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:

![coverage report](http://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)

Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.

#### Configuration

The default Jest coverage configuration can be overridden by adding any of the following supported keys to a Jest config in your package.json.

Supported overrides:

- [`collectCoverageFrom`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoveragefrom-array)
- [`coverageReporters`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragereporters-array-string)
- [`coverageThreshold`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragethreshold-object)
- [`snapshotSerializers`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#snapshotserializers-array-string)

Example package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "your-package",
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverageFrom": [
      "src/**/*.{js,jsx}",
      "!<rootDir>/node_modules/",
      "!<rootDir>/path/to/dir/"
    ],
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 90,
        "functions": 90,
        "lines": 90,
        "statements": 90
      }
    },
    "coverageReporters": ["text"],
    "snapshotSerializers": ["my-serializer-module"]
  }
}
```

### Continuous Integration

By default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.

When creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.

Popular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:

### On CI servers

#### Travis CI

1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis. You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.
1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.

```
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 8
cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules
script:
  - npm run build
  - npm test
```

1. Trigger your first build with a git push.
1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.

#### CircleCI

Follow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.

### On your own environment

##### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm test
```

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm run build
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)

##### Windows (Powershell)

```Powershell
($env:CI = $true) -and (npm test)
```

```Powershell
($env:CI = $true) -and (npm run build)
```

##### Linux, macOS (Bash)

```bash
CI=true npm test
```

```bash
CI=true npm run build
```

The test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.

> If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.

The build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.

### Disabling jsdom

If you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely set `--env=node`, and your tests will run faster:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test"
+   "test": "react-scripts test --env=node"
```

To help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:

- Any browser globals like `window` and `document`
- [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)
- [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)
- [`mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)

In contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:

- [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)
- [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)

Finally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).

### Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)

### Editor Integration

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.

## Analyzing the Bundle Size

[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes
JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code
bloat is coming from.

To add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install --save source-map-explorer
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add source-map-explorer
```

Then in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:

```diff
   "scripts": {
+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.*",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test",
```

Then to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze
script.

```
npm run build
npm run analyze
```

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

### Static Server

For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```sh
serve -h
```

### Other Solutions

You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.

Here’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
});

app.listen(9000);
```

The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.

The `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.

However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.

### Customizing Environment Variables for Arbitrary Build Environments

You can create an arbitrary build environment by creating a custom `.env` file and loading it using [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd).

For example, to create a build environment for a staging environment:

1. Create a file called `.env.staging`
1. Set environment variables as you would any other `.env` file (e.g. `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://api-staging.example.com`)
1. Install [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd)
   ```sh
   $ npm install env-cmd --save
   $ # or
   $ yarn add env-cmd
   ```
1. Add a new script to your `package.json`, building with your new environment:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build:staging": "env-cmd .env.staging npm run build"
     }
   }
   ```

Now you can run `npm run build:staging` to build with the staging environment config.
You can specify other environments in the same way.

Variables in `.env.production` will be used as fallback because `NODE_ENV` will always be set to `production` for a build.

### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Use the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).<br>
You can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).

#### Resolving Heroku Deployment Errors

Sometimes `npm run build` works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.

##### "Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory'"

If you get something like this:

```
remote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:
remote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory'
MyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src
```

It means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you `import` matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.

This is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So `MyDirectory` and `mydirectory` are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the `import` statements on Heroku remotes.

##### "Could not find a required file."

If you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:

```
remote: Could not find a required file.
remote:   Name: `index.html`
remote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public
remote:
remote: npm ERR! Linux 3.13.0-105-generic
remote: npm ERR! argv "/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/node" "/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/npm" "run" "build"
```

In this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that’s not ignored on your local `.gitignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`.
